<h1>Banking Management System</h1>

<p>
    This project is a simple Banking Management System developed in C++. It allows users to manage their bank accounts, perform transactions, check balances, and more. It serves as an essential learning tool for anyone looking to understand basic banking operations and software development.
</p>

<h2>How to Create the Banking Management System</h2>

<p>
    The project is designed to simulate basic banking operations. To get started with the development of this project, follow these steps:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Define the Banking Operations:</strong>
        <p>Start by defining the key operations you want to simulate, such as creating an account, depositing money, withdrawing money, checking balances, and transferring funds between accounts.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Create Account Class:</strong>
        <p>Create a class that represents a bank account. This class should include member variables for the account holder's name, account balance, and account number. Define functions to perform operations like deposit, withdraw, and transfer money.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Implement Menu System:</strong>
        <p>Develop a simple text-based menu system that allows users to choose operations such as viewing account details, depositing money, or withdrawing money. Display the options clearly to the user.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Handle User Input:</strong>
        <p>Allow the user to input their choice, and validate the input to ensure only valid options are selected. You may also add error handling for invalid transactions (e.g., withdrawing more money than the account balance).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Implement Data Persistence (Optional):</strong>
        <p>If you want to persist the user data (such as account details), consider using file handling to save and load the account information. This way, users can interact with their accounts even after restarting the program.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Test the System:</strong>
        <p>Once the basic operations are implemented, test the system thoroughly. Ensure that all functions (deposit, withdraw, transfer) work as expected and that the account balance updates correctly after each operation.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
